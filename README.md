# Cocos2dx-Undertale-Engine
Cocos2dx Engine  with some simple Lua bindings, that makes it easy to mess with the Undertale to create mods or new battles

So far I have it loading the UNDERTALE.EXE, extracting the data.win file then loading the textures and 
sprites into the hellow world screen.  Should be able to compile it by just loading up the win32 2015 solution.

I have font loading working on a seperate code base as well as the vibrading text, but I am doing some other cleanup
first.
