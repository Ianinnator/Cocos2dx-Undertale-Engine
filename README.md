# Cocos2dx-Undertale-Engine
Cocos2dx Engine  with some simple Lua bindings, that makes it easy to mess with the Undertale to create mods or new battles

So far I have it loading the UNDERTALE.EXE, extracting the data.win file then loading the textures and 
sprites into the hellow world screen.  Should be able to compile it by just loading up the win32 2015 solution.

This is just a build for messing around with the resources.  You need to have at-least the data.win file in the same directory as the exe and it will extract a bunch of things.  This is STILL in progress.

You can move Chara around using the arrow keys or the WASD keys.

Press the '+' and '-' by the keypad to cycle though all the rooms, press '*' on the keypad to turn and off all non-visible 
objects. 

Press the slash by the keypad to turn off the buggy collision

Press 'Print Screen' or F12 to screenshot And press 0-8 to turn on and off individual backgrounds.
